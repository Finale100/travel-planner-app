Welcome to Travel Planner!

This is a single-page application created with a interactive JS view layer and Ruby on Rails API. The rails API utilizes CRUD
functionality throughout each model. This app was created to help organize your personal travel itineraries. The user will
be able to see their list of trips and navigate into for a more detailed view. As the user maneuvers into a specific trip
they'll have CRUD functionality on each model. With each edit, the changes will be persisted to the database and the view page
will display those changes without a hard refresh. Thanks for stopping by to checkout the app!
